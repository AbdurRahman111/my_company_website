                <p>CSO conducts research on many issues affecting the Somali diaspora in Britain. Through learning more about these issues, we are better placed to support our member organisations and the Somali diaspora. Here you will find a library of all of our research and that of others relevant to our work, which is available to download.</p>

                <h2>Why do we undertake&nbsp;research?</h2>

                <p>Research is the foundation of the work that we do. Through it, we can form opinions and make informed decisions on our strategic direction, as well as work to influence decision makers in governemnt and other areas of policy that affect the Somali diaspora.</p>

                <p>The changing and challenging landscape within which the Somali diaspora live and work in Britain has meant that more research needs to be done to enhance our understanding of how we can improve the service delivery of our member organisations and more broadly the lived experiences of Somalis in Britain.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We are currently researching the following:&nbsp;</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Somali Youth in the Criminal Justice System&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>The Somali Community and their State of Health &amp; Wellbeing</li>
                    <li>The Somali Community and their State of Housing&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>The Somali Community and their State of Employment</li>
                    <li>The Somali Community and their State of Education&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>

                <p>CSO is always interested in collaborative research work and partnerships. &nbsp;If you would like to discuss potential collaborative work, or have identified research areas that you think we should be exploring, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@councilofsomaliorgs.com">info@councilofsomaliorgs.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
